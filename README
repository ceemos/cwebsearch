cwebsearch
==========

A web frontend for Russ Cox' awesome Go codesearch:
http://code.google.com/p/codesearch/
(Theory: http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html )

Results are displayed as you type. Not intended for use over the Internet.

Usage:

first get cindex and csearch running, something like:
go get code.google.com/p/codesearch/cmd/cindex
go get code.google.com/p/codesearch/cmd/csearch

Then you should be able to `go run cwebsearch.go`

Build an index with cindex first, then run cwebsearch. A browser should show 
the search form on http://localhost:4000.


TODO:
- The web-frontend could use some stylesheets and more functionality.
- the inbuilt grep needs to be modified to show more context around a line.

LICENSE:
BSD-Style, like the original Go code.
